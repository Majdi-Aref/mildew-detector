# Mildew Detector

- 'Mildew Detector' is an application that helps differentiate between healthy cherry leaves and those that are infected with powdery mildew, which is a fungal disease that can infect many plants.

- I built this app as my portfolio project 5 at Code Institute.

- The manual detection of powdery mildew in cherry trees, which is done by examining the leaves with the naked eye, is not a feasible method because, im most cases, the total number of the cherry trees is huge.

- This project implements a modern and practical machine learning program that examines a cherry leaf image and immediately determines whether it is healthy or infected with powdery mildew.

- Businesses who grow cherry trees can profit from this project.

# Table of contents

# 1. Dataset content

- The dataset is taken from Code Institute's account on Kaggle.
- It consists of 2104 healthy cherry leaves images and 2104 cherry leaves images that contain powdery mildew.
- The owner of this dataset is Farmy & Foods, which is a business that grows cherry crops.

# 2. Business requirements

- To determine whether a cherry leaf is healthy or infected with powdery mildew, Farmy & Foods is examining each cherry leaf with the naked eye, which is an arduous method that costs gigantic amounts of time and money.

- Farmy & Foods is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a cherry leaf that is healthy from one that contains powdery mildew.

- The customer, Farmy & Foods, is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

- This state-of-the-art project presents a machine learning program that inspects each cherry leaf and immediately predicts whether it is healthy or infected with powdery mildew, which effectively saves both time and money and perfectly meets the customer's needs.
